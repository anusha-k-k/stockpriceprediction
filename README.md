ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction - Project Description

Overview:
This project simulates future stock price predictions for selected companies using a simple stochastic model
based on geometric Brownian motion. It generates synthetic price trajectories for multiple stocks over a
user-defined number of days and presents the results in both a tabular format in the terminal and a line chart for visual analysis.

Key Features::
Multiple Stocks Support: Predicts future prices for a customizable list of stock tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA).
Calendar-Based Forecasting: Simulates prices across actual calendar days, including weekends.
Visual Representation: Plots the price paths of all selected stocks using Matplotlib for easy visual comparison.

Technologies Used
Python and its Tools like
     numpy â€“ For generating random returns
     pandas â€“ For tabular data structure and manipulation
     matplotlib â€“ For plotting the price trends

Conclusion:
While this project does not aim to predict actual future prices, it demonstrates how stock price movements can be modeled and visualized using Python. It highlights the importance of understanding randomness, volatility, and the power of simulations in financial analytics
